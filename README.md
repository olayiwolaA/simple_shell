# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
## Project done in teams of 2 people (Authors: Oyewale Olayiwola, Okeke Omolola)
## :gree_openbook: Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
## Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
## Tasks
### 0. Betty would be proud
* Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks
### 1. Simple shell 0.1
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
* Usage: simple_shell
### 2. Simple shell 0.2
Simple shell 0.1 +
* Handle command lines with arguments
### 3. Simple shell 0.3
Simple shell 0.2 +
* Handle the PATH
* fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist
### 4. Simple shell 0.4
Simple shell 0.3 +
* Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
* Usage: exit
* You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit
### 5. Simple shell 1.0

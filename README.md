# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
## Project done in teams of 2 people (Authors: Oyewale Olayiwola, Okeke Omolola)
## :open_book: Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
## Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
## Testing
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```
